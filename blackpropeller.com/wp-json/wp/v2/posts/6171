Quora ads are helping advertisers reach potential customers who browse the Q&amp;As that match their products and\/or services.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you are advertising for an ecommerce website that sells dog food, then you might want to reach potential customers who are browsing Q&amp;As related to pet food, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which is the best dog food?<\/li>\n<li>Which is the best dry dog food?<\/li>\n<li>What do dogs love to eat the most?<\/li>\n<li>What is the best giant dog breed puppy food?<\/li>\n<li>Is it okay to feed puppy food to an adult dog?<\/li>\n<li>Which is the best puppy food &#8211; grain or grain-free?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>People browsing and reading answers to such questions are likely pet owners looking to explore the best food options for their dogs. Sounds like an opportune time to get your pet food brand in front of them right?<\/p>\n<p>Reaching relevant prospects when they are in the consideration phase of the customer journey is what Quora ads do best.<\/p>\n<p>Quora ads make it easier for you to promote your brand and products leveraging native-ad formats that don&#8217;t look like ads.<\/p>\n<p>Here is an example of a Quora text ad in action:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6176\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-text-ad-example.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"363\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-text-ad-example-200x121.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-text-ad-example-300x181.png 300w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-text-ad-example-400x241.png 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-text-ad-example-600x362.png 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-text-ad-example.png 602w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/business.quora.com\/Quoras-advertising-platform-is-now-open-to-all-businesses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The ad matches Quora&#8217;s regular question and answer pattern and doesn&#8217;t look like an ad.

Text Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Text ads follow the native question and answer pattern on the Quora platform. These ads can appear on the Q&amp;A pages, the Quora newsletter, home feeds, and topic feeds. Placement is available on both text and mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p>Here is an example of a Text ad on Quora:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6177\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-text-ad.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"363\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-text-ad-200x121.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-text-ad-300x181.png 300w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-text-ad-400x241.png 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-text-ad-600x362.png 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-text-ad.png 602w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/quoraadsupport.zendesk.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360029041452-Overview-of-Text-Ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Source<\/a><\/p>\n<p>You should use the following ad specifications in your text ads:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The headline should be within 65 characters.<\/li>\n<li>The body text should be within 105 characters.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2. Image Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Image ads let your brand stand out in the text-based feed format of Quora. These ads appear on home feeds, and topic feeds. Image ads also appear on home feeds and topic feeds, but since these feeds follow a text-based pattern, Quora converts the image ads into text ads.<\/p>\n<p>You should use the following ad specifications in your image ads:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Headline text should be within 65 characters.<\/li>\n<li>Body text should be within 105 characters.<\/li>\n<li>The hero image should be in either PNG or JPG format with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and minimum image dimensions of 600 x 335 pixels.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The company logo should either be in PNG or JPG format and 500 x 500 pixels.<\/p>\n<p>Here is an example of an image ad in action from QSmart Travel:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6178\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-image-ad.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"363\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-image-ad-200x121.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-image-ad-300x181.png 300w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-image-ad-400x241.png 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-image-ad-600x362.png 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-image-ad.png 602w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3.

Increase Your Brand Reach To Millions of Users<\/h3>\n<p>Quora is growing rapidly as a social network having millions of users worldwide. Quora users engage the Q&amp;A platform to research companies or products.<\/p>\n<p>They ask questions from other Quorans related to a product or service they are using or planning to use in future.<\/p>\n<p>Quora logs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/How-many-users-does-Quora-have-in-2019\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">678.8 million monthly views<\/a> globally, giving advertisers a wider opportunity to target their relevant audiences who actively search for solutions similar to what they provide.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Attract Quality Organic Traffic<\/h3>\n<p>Quora questions and answers often rank highly in search engines like Google and Bing. When people ask questions in Google, the relevant response appears in the search result.<\/p>\n<p>Quora&#8217;s answers are more direct and specific to the question, which is why Quora pages rank well on search engines and attract more traffic.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Leverage Advertising On A Low Competition Channel<\/h3>\n<p>Quora is still emerging as an online advertising channel. Many companies are yet to explore the platform.<\/p>\n<p>Less competition makes it easier for companies to stand out and acquire new customers.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, the sooner you begin advertising on Quora, the faster you will start generating leads for your business.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Reach To More Relevant Audience<\/h3>\n<p>Users are continuously looking for answers to their questions. Quora has a vast knowledge base where users explore questions on a variety of topics.<\/p>\n<p>People are constantly looking for solutions, and when your ads appear next to relevant questions related to the products or services you sell, the chances of conversions are higher.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Target Audience With Contextual Targeting<\/h3>\n<p>For advertising on relevant question pages, Quora provides a contextual targeting feature.<\/p>\n<p>The advertiser has to choose a topic on which their ads will show up and the keywords they want to target. These details are used to target relevant user questions.<\/p>\n<p>Hence, your ads appear next to questions with the highest chances of people clicking on the ads.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Control Ad Spend<\/h3>\n<p>Quora has a bidding system in place that decides the price of running ads.<\/p>\n<p>The cost of advertising depends on different factors like targeted keyword, audience, competition, etc. Quora offers three types of bidding options &#8211; Cost per Click (CPC), Cost per Impression (CPM), and Conversion Optimized.<\/p>\n<p>In cost per click, interested advertisers bid for the cost of every click on their ads. The starting bidding price is $0.01.<\/p>\n<p>In cost per Impression, advertisers can bid for 1000 impressions on their ads. The minimum bidding price is $0.20.<\/p>\n<p>In conversion-optimized bidding, advertisers bid for Cost Per Action (CPA) and only pay when their ads result in an action.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Track Engagement And Utilize Remarketing<\/h3>\n<p>Quora offers a tool called Quora Pixel, which is placed on the advertiser&#8217;s website to track traffic and conversions.<\/p>\n<p>The tool is designed to identify the number of people landing on the website after clicking the ad. It also keeps a record of the type of actions they take within the site.<\/p>\n<p>Using the tool, advertisers can build a website audience and use it for Website Traffic Targeting, called remarketing and Lookalike Targeting.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Choose Between Different Ad Options<\/h3>\n<p>Quora offers several ad formats \u2013 Image, Text, Promoted Answers, and Lead Gen Forms. As an advertiser, you can run different campaigns to test the effectiveness of ad options and select the format that works best for your business.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Promote Your Ads In Quora Digest<\/h3>\n<p>Quora Digest is the newsletter that every Quora user receives. It includes several questions with one best answer to each question, along with ads.<\/p>\n<p>The questions are relevant, as they are based on the user&#8217;s search history and interests. Since these newsletters are highly personalized, they have high opening rates, and the ads included are clickable.<\/p>\n<p>Hence, you have the option to reach relevant audiences via the highly popular Quora digest.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Reach Specific Audiences<\/h3>\n<p>Audience Targeting is an option in Quora that enables advertisers to create a target audience list from their site. They can set a filter to choose the visitors or upload a CSV file of customers on their website and target them on Quora. Creating a list of target audiences is helpful for businesses because they can focus only on valuable prospects.<\/p>\n<h3>11. Target Audiences Based On Geographical Regions<\/h3>\n<p>Not all businesses are global. Many of them are limited to specific regions. For them targeting an international audience is useless and costly. Quora&#8217;s location targeting allows you to pick particular countries, cities, and even postcodes, where you want your ads to be shown. Alternatively, you can also exclude some countries you don&#8217;t wish to target.<\/p>\n<h3>12. Choose Your Target Device<\/h3>\n<p>Desktop and mobile ads have different pricing on Quora. Desktop auctions usually have higher costs. To help small businesses, Quora offers device and browser targeting. Using this option, you can choose the device types, the specific mobile platforms (iOS or Android) and browsers you want to display your ads on.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Quora Ads Manager<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>The Quora Ads Manager is your ad campaign dashboard to find all the information related to your Quora ads campaign. It is the platform to create, run, and manage all your Quora ads and consists of five major sections:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Manage Ads<\/h3>\n<p>The Manage Ads section lets you control all your ad campaigns on Quora and enables you to evaluate the performance of your ads.<\/p>\n<p>Manage Ads displays the impressions, clicks, generic click-through conversions, and your ad spend.<\/p>\n<p>From this section, you can upload your ads, download them when required, edit your campaign when needed, or delete any particular campaign.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Pixels and Events<\/h3>\n<p>The Pixels and Events section helps you to set up tracking Pixel on your website.<\/p>\n<p>The Quora Pixel is a small piece of code that lets you track traffic and conversions when someone visits your website after clicking your website link via the Quora ads campaign.<\/p>\n<p>It consists of two codes, namely, the Base Pixel and the Event Pixel. You should add the Base Pixel to every page of your website. The Event Pixel should be added on the landing page (for example, the thank you page) where you wish to track specific conversions.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Audiences<\/h3>\n<p>The Audiences section lets you select a target audience for your ads campaign. Your ads are displayed to people who fall in any of the below three categories for maximum engagement.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Website Traffic Audience<\/b> &#8211; Quora will automatically select an audience that matches your existing website traffic persona. Therefore, you can be assured that you don\u2019t receive any irrelevant clicks on your campaign that leads to ad spend wastage.<\/li>\n<li><b>List Match Audience<\/b> &#8211; If you wish to tailor your ad campaign towards a specific group of audiences, then you should choose List Match Audience.<\/li>\n<li><b>Lookalike Audience<\/b> &#8211; Like Facebook Lookalike Audiences, the Quora Lookalike Audience lets you target your ads towards a group of audiences based on an existing audience group in your Quora Ads Manager.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>4. Lead Gen<\/h3>\n<p>The Lead Gen section enables you to create lead generation forms for your ad campaigns. With the help of Lead Gen forms, you can acquire high-intent prospects in a few clicks.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Reporting<\/h3>\n<p>The Reporting section lets you prepare custom reports to measure the returns on investment from your Quora ads spend.<\/p>\n<p>You can provide a name of your report, add recipients, select report type (all campaigns, ad, ad set, campaign, or leads generated), choose a time span, and select a frequency (one-time or recurring) for your reports.<\/p>\n<p>Once you start running your ad campaigns, then you can see the following metrics at the campaign, ad set, and ad level:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Impressions<\/b>: Measures the number of times your Quora ad was viewed.<\/li>\n<li><b>Clicks<\/b>: Measures the number of times your Quora ad was clicked.<\/li>\n<li><b>CTR<\/b>: Measures the Clickthrough rate, which is calculated by dividing total clicks by total impressions.<\/li>\n<li><b>Clickthrough conversions<\/b>: Measures the total conversions that happen when the user clicks on your ad and triggers the event pixel within 28 days.<\/li>\n<li><b>Viewthrough conversions<\/b>: Measures the total conversions that happen when the user views your ads and triggers the event pixel within 24 hours.<\/li>\n<li><b>Conversion percentage<\/b>: Measure the conversion rate of your campaign, ad set, or ad.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>How To Create Your First Ad Campaign On Quora<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Quora ads enable you to reach millions

For instance, you can retarget users by keywords or questions they have viewed before.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6193\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-behavioral-targeting.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"201\" height=\"237\" title=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Broad Targeting<\/b><\/p>\n<p>If your focus is on branding, then you can choose the broad targeting option. This will enable your ads to show ads everywhere on Quora. Broad targeting will generate maximum impressions and clicks as compared to other targeting options.<\/p>\n<p>For example, I am selecting the \u201cContextual Targeting<b>\u201d <\/b>option with keywords. Here, I have to add some target keywords related to my business, and my ads will get displayed near all the questions that match my provided keywords.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see in the image below, I have added keywords related to dog food.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6194\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-broad-targeting.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"318\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-broad-targeting-200x106.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-broad-targeting-300x158.png 300w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-broad-targeting-400x211.png 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-broad-targeting-600x317.png 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-broad-targeting.png 602w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Remember, you can even add negative keywords, which are words that you wish to exclude from your campaign. You can add keywords that you want to exclude from your ad targeting.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, I can include \u2018homemade dog food\u2019 as a negative keyword because people reading questions related to homemade dog food are not looking for branded pet food.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, you can think of keywords to exclude from your campaign. Excluding negative keywords is necessary because it helps to save your ad budget from irrelevant impressions or clicks.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 5: Choose Additional Targeting<\/h3>\n<p>In this step, you can select device type and browser. You can choose any mobile device and browser depending on your targeted audience.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, you can select the gender of your audience in case your products or services are catered towards a specific gender.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you sell cosmetics for women, you should choose additional targeting to select only females.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6195\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-additional-targeting.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"325\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-additional-targeting-200x108.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-additional-targeting-300x162.png 300w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-additional-targeting-400x216.png 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-additional-targeting-600x324.png 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-additional-targeting.png 602w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Quora also allows you to filter questions and audiences from your ad set.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6196\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-exclude.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"159\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-exclude-200x53.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-exclude-300x79.png 300w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-exclude-400x106.png 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-exclude-600x158.png 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-exclude.png 602w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Step 6: Set A Bid<\/h3>\n<p>Here, you should set a bid for your campaign. Depending on the ad delivery, you have three options to choose from:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Optimize for clicks<\/b>: If you want people to click on your ad, you should optimize for clicks.<\/li>\n<li><b>Optimize for impressions<\/b>: if you wish to improve branding and display your ad text with the brand slogan in front of several users, you should optimize for impressions.<\/li>\n<li><b>Optimize for Generic conversions<\/b>: If you have installed Quora Pixel on your website to track generic events, you can use this option to optimize your ad delivery for conversions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6197\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-set-bid.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"260\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-set-bid-200x86.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-set-bid-300x130.png 300w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-set-bid-400x173.png 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-set-bid-600x259.png 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-set-bid.png 602w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once you have selected the ad delivery, you should enter the amount you are willing to pay for every click, per thousand impressions, or every conversion.<\/p>\n<p>According to your Ad set configuration, Quora will give you an estimate on the weekly impressions your ad will receive along with a CPC bid value.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6198\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-bid-summary.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"351\" height=\"362\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-bid-summary-200x206.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-bid-summary-291x300.png 291w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-bid-summary.png 351w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Step 7: Create An Ad<\/h3>\n<p>The final step in Quora advertising is creating an ad.<\/p>\n<p>You should enter a name for your ad and select an ad format from the available types:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Image Ad: To show an ad with a featured image, text, and your company logo.<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>Text Ad: To display ads without pictures, just text.<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>Promote an Answer: <\/b>In this format, you can promote your existing answers that promote your product or service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6199\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-create-ad.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"276\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-create-ad-200x92.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-create-ad-300x138.png 300w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-create-ad-400x183.png 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-create-ad-600x275.png 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-create-ad.png 602w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can add a Lead Gen Form to any of these ad formats.

You need to enter a compelling headline and ad text on every ad format that persuades the users to click on your ad.<\/p>\n<p>Besides, the CTA (Call To Action) button is the most essential part of your ad. Quora offers different CTA options to choose from:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn More<\/li>\n<li>Get The App<\/li>\n<li>Apply Now<\/li>\n<li>Book Now<\/li>\n<li>Contact Us<\/li>\n<li>Donate Now<\/li>\n<li>Download<\/li>\n<li>Shop Now<\/li>\n<li>Sign Up<\/li>\n<li>Watch More<\/li>\n<li>Get Quote<\/li>\n<li>Follow Us<\/li>\n<li>Play Now<\/li>\n<li>Start Now<\/li>\n<li>Free Trial<\/li>\n<li>Read More<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here is the ad after filling in all the required details:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6200\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-ad-fields.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"618\" height=\"490\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-ad-fields-200x159.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-ad-fields-300x238.png 300w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-ad-fields-400x317.png 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-ad-fields-600x476.png 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-ad-fields.png 618w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To make your ad more compelling and attractive, you can add an image and company logo.<\/p>\n<p>Now, add a landing page URL where you want users to visit to check your products or services.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6201\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-ad-url.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"612\" height=\"178\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-ad-url-200x58.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-ad-url-300x87.png 300w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-ad-url-400x116.png 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-ad-url-600x175.png 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/quora-ad-url.png 612w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now, you can also preview your ad on both desktop and mobile.

A great tip is to create a duplicate copy of your desktop campaign for targeting mobile users. You can save on your advertising budget by choosing this approach.<\/li>\n<li>Test your ad copies and landing pages to improve conversion rates.<\/li>\n<li>Consider intelligent budgeting by pausing worst performing campaigns and increasing the budget for best performing campaigns.<\/li>\n<li>Ensure that the topics and interests you are targeting have enough search volume to achieve maximum impressions and clicks.<\/li>\n<li>Always bid higher because high bids win you more ad placements leading to greater conversions. However, you will only pay the amount required to beat the next highest bidder.<\/li>\n<li>Use List Match Audiences, Website Traffic Audiences, and Lookalike Audiences to retarget users who have visited your site.<\/li>\n<li>Test different ad headlines continuously to win more clicks.<\/li>\n<li>Use statements and question headlines in your text ads as they work best in driving clicks.<\/li>\n<li>Always use the maximum available character limits for headline and body character count. This will enhance the visibility of your ads.<\/li>\n<li>Test different CTA buttons because using just one CTA on multiple ad campaigns might result in low conversions and high campaign costs.<\/li>\n<li>Use proper English and grammar and create high-resolution images to represent your product or service.<\/li>\n<li>Create ads that target the audience&#8217;s pain points and have a clear call to action.<\/li>\n<li>For image ads, test around four images simultaneously to optimize your campaigns for maximum clicks.<\/li>\n<li>Use brand logos, product shots, and slogans to help people remember your brand.<\/li>\n<li>Add links to promoted answers if it directly answers the user&#8217;s questions. Don&#8217;t forget to add UTM in Quora answer links because this will help you find the number of clicks your link receives from Quora Promoted Answers.<\/li>\n<li>If you are looking for higher lead quality, you should use more Lead Gen Form ads. However, if you are looking for maximum leads, then keep the form fields to a minimum.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Quora Ads FAQs<\/b><\/h2>\n<h3>Are Quora ads worth advertising?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, Quora is worth advertising.
