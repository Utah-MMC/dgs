The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ads\/library\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook Ad Library<\/a> tool can show you every ad that\u2019s running for your competitors or in other industries. You can search by keyword or advertiser to see which ads are running, how long they\u2019ve run, and how much the advertiser is spending. It\u2019s kinda like a candy store for Facebook ads inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not enough to just have good Facebook ads anymore. If you want top-tier performance, you need great ads, ads that &#8220;stop the scroll.&#8221; You also need a lot of ads, ad fatigue is a real thing. And the more you spend, the harder you\u2019ll have to work to stay ahead of it.<\/p>\n<p>We use the Ad Library to spark ideas for new ads, and it\u2019s helped us find dozens of great Facebook ad examples and ideas for what to test in ad creative. Here are some of our favorite finds.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>1. Keap<\/h2>\n<p>There are influencers, and then there are icons. Neil Patel is an icon. Or, as he might put it, he\u2019s &#8220;a pretty big deal.&#8221; So when Keap can say they\u2019re Neil\u2019s top choice for a CRM, that\u2019s a pretty big deal, too.<\/p>\n<h2><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4162\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/keap-facebook-ad-example.png\" alt=\"Keap&#039;s facebook ad uses a powerful endorsement\" width=\"555\" height=\"781\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/keap-facebook-ad-example-200x281.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/keap-facebook-ad-example-213x300.png 213w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/keap-facebook-ad-example-400x563.png 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/keap-facebook-ad-example.png 555w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px\" \/><\/h2>\n<h3>What Makes This a Great Facebook Ad Example:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The influencer: <\/strong>Neil Patel has a massive following and undisputed authority in digital marketing and managing digital businesses. The second his fans see this ad, Keap will be on his fans\u2019 shortlist if they need a CRM.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The one tool you need:<\/strong>\u00a0Digital marketers tend to use dozens of tools, often referred to as their \u201cstack.\u201d Managing all those tools and getting those tools to work together is no small task. The possibility of taking all that hassle away is a powerful motivator for this audience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The secret sauce:<\/strong>\u00a0Everyone&#8217;s looking for their secret sauce, especially marketers. And if someone as successful as Neil Patel is calling Keap their secret sauce, that&#8217;s a pretty compelling endorsement.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>2. DribbleUp<\/h2>\n<p>Most advertising messaging works off of a very simple formula:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identify a problem.<\/li>\n<li>Introduce the solution.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The art is in picking which problem to identify and how to describe that problem, and then offering the solution in a way that makes your audience want to leap into it. DribbleUp\u2019s ad does all this, and in seven words (13 if you count the words in the text section above the photograph).<\/p>\n<h2><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4164\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DribbleUp.png\" alt=\"DribbleUp&#039;s ad makes use of contrast\" width=\"730\" height=\"1078\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DribbleUp-200x295.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DribbleUp-203x300.png 203w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DribbleUp-400x591.png 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DribbleUp-600x886.png 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DribbleUp-693x1024.png 693w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DribbleUp.png 730w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" \/><\/h2>\n<h3>Why This is a Great Ad Example:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contrast:<\/strong>\u00a0That black and yellow color contrast leaps off the page. DribbleUp uses this contrast to highlight the 3 most important elements in the ad: the call to action, the brand and the product.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Explaining what it\u2019s not:<\/strong>\u00a0If people tend to dismiss or misunderstand your product, it\u2019s critical that you develop concise, easy-to-understand messaging that breaks those preconceptions. \u201cThis is NOT a video game\u201d immediately breaks a preconception, and it piques interest for parents. By positioning the product as a training device, and not a toy or game, parents are more apt to give it serious consideration.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>3. Instacart<\/h2>\n<p>Instacart has two key audiences: The people it wants to deliver groceries to, and the people who will deliver those groceries. The purpose of this ad is to recruit the people who will be delivering the groceries.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4181\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/InstacartAd.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"716\" height=\"1102\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/InstacartAd-195x300.png 195w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/InstacartAd-200x308.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/InstacartAd-400x616.png 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/InstacartAd-600x923.png 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/InstacartAd-665x1024.png 665w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/InstacartAd.png 716w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 716px) 100vw, 716px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>What Makes This a Great Facebook Ad:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It offers its audience the chance to be a hero: <\/strong>Most people are hard-wired to help others. So the opportunity to help people and get paid for it will appeal to many.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Calling out the competition:<\/strong> Instacart knows that the people who are likely to work for them would also consider working for Uber or Lyft. And while it&#8217;s clear that&#8217;s who Instacart is calling out here, they were able to do it without any namedropping,. That makes the message even more powerful.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>4. Noom<\/h2>\n<p>Noom is a diet app that wants to end dieting; they focus more on behavior change and the psychological side of eating. This gives them an edge in a ferociously competitive market, and they use their brand positioning well in their ads.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4059\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Noom.png\" alt=\"Noom ad has top notch copy\" width=\"334\" height=\"616\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Noom-163x300.png 163w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Noom-200x369.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Noom.png 334w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>What Makes This a Great Facebook Ad Example:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The copy: <\/strong> Love the ad copy here. Talk about \u201cmake \u2018em feel\u201d and tapping into inspiration. The \u201cwhen you\u201d repetition is almost like a mantra, and each variation is crafted specifically to echo the desires of Noom\u2019s target audience. Noom helps the reader see themselves in each of the examples, then brings it all home with the \u201cThat\u2019s Noom\u201d close.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The positioning: <\/strong>As mentioned earlier, Noom positions itself as an anti-diet. This is a smart way to reach the segment of the weight loss market they really want: people who are ready to make a permanent change in not just how they eat, but how they think about food.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>5. Happy Socks<\/h2>\n<p>Want attention? Just be weird. Really weird. Especially if you\u2019ve got the advantage of being a tiny startup or a small company that doesn\u2019t have to go through rounds of creative approvals or legal reviews.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4049\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/HappySocks.png\" alt=\"Happy Socks ad is unapologetically on brand\" width=\"347\" height=\"749\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/HappySocks-139x300.png 139w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/HappySocks-200x432.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/HappySocks.png 347w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>What Makes This a Great Ad Example:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It &#8220;stops the scroll&#8221;:<\/strong>\u00a0The eye immediately tries to figure out what it\u2019s looking at. I spent a good 10 seconds just wondering about the steps and the rake, much less the headgear in this ad.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It is unapologetically on brand:<\/strong>\u00a0Even if that means it turns some other people off. If you\u2019re the sort of person this ad appeals to, this brand\u2019s off-the-wall approach will make you feel like you\u2019ve found your tribe.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>6. Green Bean Delivery<\/h2>\n<p>Anyone who sees a few of their favorite brands in the photo of this ad will immediately know Green Bean Delivery is a fit for them.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4047\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/GreenBeanDelivery.png\" alt=\"Green Bean Delivery&#039;s uses a testimonial in their Facebook Ad\" width=\"347\" height=\"530\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/GreenBeanDelivery-196x300.png 196w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/GreenBeanDelivery-200x305.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/GreenBeanDelivery.png 347w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Why This is a Great Ad Example:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The testimonial<\/strong>: People trust testimonials way more than marketing copy. (Please don\u2019t tell our copywriter that.)<\/li>\n<li><strong>The photo<\/strong>: It\u2019s using a \u201creal\u201d photo, not a stock photo. Shiny, perfect-looking stock photos look, well\u2026shiny and perfect. But they don\u2019t look real. Often, a less-perfect looking but \u201crealer\u201d photo will out-perform the stock photo. Especially when it comes to people.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The bottom section of ad copy:<\/strong>\u00a0That logo and big type pull the eye down to the rest of the copy in the ad. Even more importantly, it pulls the eye down to the \u201cLearn More\u201d call to action button.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>7. Muscle Milk<\/h2>\n<p>This is a product that appeals to a limited audience: people who strength train. But that limitation is actually an edge because it lets Muscle Milk not even pretend to be for everybody.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4192\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MuscleMilk2.png\" alt=\"Muscle Milk ad appeals to core audience\" width=\"335\" height=\"546\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MuscleMilk2-184x300.png 184w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MuscleMilk2-200x326.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MuscleMilk2.png 335w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>What Makes This a Great Facebook Ad Example:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s true to its audience <\/strong>&#8211; Muscle Milk isn\u2019t thinking twice about trying to be all things to all people. These ads are meant for their core audience \u2013 and nobody else.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Great copy <\/strong>&#8211; As the end of the video says, \u201cMuscle milk helps build muscle. But it takes heart to build strength.\u201d That\u2019s some tight copy. If that doesn&#8217;t make you want to go pound a bottle Muscle Milk and train like a madman, check your pulse.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>8. Trolls<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s smart to look beyond your industry if you want to find truly break-out advertising ideas. The movie industry is one of my favorite places for crossover ad inspiration.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4140\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Trolls.png\" alt=\"Trolls ad has color in spades\" width=\"333\" height=\"702\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Trolls-142x300.png 142w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Trolls-200x422.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Trolls.png 333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Why This is a Great Facebook Ad:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Showstopping color:<\/strong>\u00a0You want color? You&#8217;ve got color. And the sparkle just kicks it all up another notch. Even if you&#8217;re not a Trolls fan, you&#8217;re not likely to scroll past this ad without giving it a second look.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Immediacy:<\/strong>\u00a0Movie ads traditionally had to drive people to a theater. Not anymore. This ad gets to offer immediate access to the film. Instant gratification, instant conversion.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>9. Drone Launch Academy<\/h2>\n<p>The drone business is booming and everyone wants in. I mean, who wouldn&#8217;t want to make a living flying a toy airplane around. But apparently, getting FAA certified isn&#8217;t all fun and games. That&#8217;s where Drone Launch Academy comes in.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4041\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DroneLaunchAcademy.png\" alt=\"Drone Launch Academy wins with a guarantee and emojis\" width=\"617\" height=\"986\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DroneLaunchAcademy-188x300.png 188w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DroneLaunchAcademy-200x320.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DroneLaunchAcademy-400x639.png 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DroneLaunchAcademy-600x959.png 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DroneLaunchAcademy.png 617w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>What Makes This a Great Facebook Ad Example:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The emojis in the ad copy:<\/strong> They break up the text so it\u2019s not a wall of words.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The guarantee:<\/strong>\u00a0If you\u2019re in their target market, being told you\u2019ll either pass this test on the first try or get your money back makes this hard to say \u201cno\u201d to.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>10. Mixtiles<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cShow, don\u2019t tell.\u201d What applied to your 4<sup>th<\/sup>-grade book report applies to advertising creative. Showing a product in action not only removes the need to explain what it does, but it also helps your audience to see themselves using it.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4176\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MixtilesAd.png\" alt=\"Mixtiles ad uses local appeal\" width=\"682\" height=\"994\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MixtilesAd-200x291.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MixtilesAd-206x300.png 206w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MixtilesAd-400x583.png 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MixtilesAd-600x874.png 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/MixtilesAd.png 682w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Why This is a Great Ad Example:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Local appeal:<\/strong>\u00a0That\u2019s a Maryland flag in the top center frame of this photograph. As I\u2019m in Maryland, this ad may be a clever example of a national campaign with local messaging.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Social proof<\/strong>: Mixtiles is loved by its customers, and it has a lot of customers. So it\u2019s smart to show the social proof of a 4.8-star rating from 30,000+ reviews. With that many people saying this is a great product, the company barely has to say anything else.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>11. Panasonic<\/h2>\n<p>Panasonic doesn\u2019t need to shout out its identity; we all know who they are. What it does need to do is to show its \u201chuman face\u201d so that its audience thinks well of this multi-national brand.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4061\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Panasonic.png\" alt=\"Panasonic ad uses timely messaging\" width=\"346\" height=\"322\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Panasonic-200x186.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Panasonic-300x279.png 300w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Panasonic.png 346w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 346px) 100vw, 346px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>What Makes This a Great Facebook Ad Example:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Appreciation<\/strong>: There\u2019s a well-earned hat tip to all the people doing good in the world. Not to diminish this messaging, but the formula of the \u201cthank you ad\u201d works well, especially for larger companies.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s timely<\/strong>: It\u2019s smart to make ads that are sensitive to what\u2019s happening in the world. To \u201cread the room,\u201d as it were. This may be the biggest challenge to advertisers in 2020: How to understand how their audiences feel about what\u2019s going on, and then how to speak to it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>12. Arizona Iced Tea<\/h2>\n<p>Any packaged goods product can play this game: Use your packaging as an arts and crafts project. Then invite your followers to contribute their own inspirations.<\/p>\n<p>So if you sell physical products\u2026what could they be made into? What could your shipping boxes be made into?<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4032\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ArizonaIcedTea.png\" alt=\"Arizona Iced Tea ad packs a visual surprise\" width=\"340\" height=\"503\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ArizonaIcedTea-200x296.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ArizonaIcedTea-203x300.png 203w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ArizonaIcedTea.png 340w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>What Makes This a Great Ad Example:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s unexpected.<\/strong> This is another example of a \u201cvisual surprise\u201d in an ad. It\u2019s a great way to make people stop and look twice.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It meets people where they are.<\/strong> This is another ad that addresses what\u2019s going on right now: Most people are stuck at home. Most of them are bored. So it offers them something to do.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>13. Eggo<\/h2>\n<p>In honor of the character \u201c11\u201d from the TV show <em>Stranger Things<\/em>, here\u2019s another example of an ad that makes its product into art.

It pops, whereas some of the other hashtag examples we\u2019ve seen get buried in copy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s vertical:<\/strong>\u00a0Reformatting your ad creative for different placements is one of the best ways to improve ad performance. It\u2019s more work, sure\u2026but it\u2019s high-return work.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>14. Headspace<\/h2>\n<p>Headspace puts out consistently gorgeous ads. If you like flat design and bold, pure colors, take a look at all the ads they\u2019re running.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4052\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Headspace2.png\" alt=\"Headspace ad makes a compelling promise\" width=\"799\" height=\"575\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Headspace2-200x144.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Headspace2-300x216.png 300w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Headspace2-400x288.png 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Headspace2-600x432.png 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Headspace2-768x553.png 768w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Headspace2.png 799w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Why This is a Great Example:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The design.<\/strong> The simple, bold graphics of Headspace\u2019s ads are unmistakable, even in the smaller-format ads that run on mobile devices.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The promise.<\/strong> Who wouldn\u2019t want to feel 28% less sad? And in just ten days? We don\u2019t all get to say things that impressive and powerful about what we\u2019re selling, but hey, when you can say stuff like that, run with it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>15. Chewy<\/h2>\n<p>Chewy is another advertiser worth tracking. They are a competitor brand (up against Amazon and Petco, among other places) and so they have to play the Hertz card and try harder.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4038\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Chewy.png\" alt=\"Chewy ad uses carousel format\" width=\"388\" height=\"384\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Chewy-66x66.png 66w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Chewy-200x198.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Chewy-300x297.png 300w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Chewy.png 388w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>What Makes This a Great Example:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The ad\u2019s format:<\/strong> Facebook carousel ads don\u2019t have to be only for ecommerce advertising. They\u2019re also a great way to offer tutorials and other content in a series or catalog-esque format.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s timely:<\/strong> This ad mentions both the Easter holiday and staying at home.

Give people something useful for free, and in return they may repay you with a page like.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s part of a series:<\/strong> A series of ads on the same theme can build off of each individual ad\u2019s performance.

This is an ad that makes people feel. Especially the type of people who are likely to use SEMRush.<\/li>\n<li><strong>FREE:<\/strong>\u00a0It\u2019s one of the most powerful words in advertising. It\u2019s especially powerful when applied to something of value, like one month\u2019s access to SEMRush. They usually charge $99.95.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>18. Digital Growth Studios<\/h2>\n<p>I know this ad works well. How well? Well enough for us to run it for a long, long time.

And Nate. Any brand can do this. It\u2019s just employee + brand sign + camera phone. 30 seconds to better ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s in our office:<\/strong>\u00a0Prospective clients want to know what it\u2019s like to work with you. Showing your office is one way to do that.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It shows a real person:<\/strong> As we mentioned in an earlier ad\u2019s description, showing regular people usually works better than showing models in stock photos. Besides, we can\u2019t have Nate thinking he\u2019s a model or something.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>19. Moz<\/h2>\n<p>Moz is a powerhouse when it comes to pretty much any kind of content.

It works really well.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The ad copy:<\/strong> Notice all the copy in the lower part of the ad. Some companies listed here go super minimalistic with copy in the bottom part of their ads. Not Moz. Maybe zigging while others zag is working for them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>20. Stitch Fix<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s always interesting to see all the endless ways advertisers use the space they\u2019re allotted. For example, in this Stitch Fix ad, the two squares in the image almost look like they are part of the interface, not a visual trick created by a savvy designer.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4133\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/StitchFix.png\" alt=\"Stitch Fix ad presents unique selling proposition\" width=\"345\" height=\"337\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/StitchFix-200x195.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/StitchFix-300x293.png 300w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/StitchFix.png 345w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Why This is a Great Ad Example:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The unique selling proposition:<\/strong> \u201cWe find the looks you\u2019ll love.\u201d It\u2019s like an elevator pitch condensed into six words. And because the copy is surrounded by white space, it reads almost as easily as the logo.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The surprise of \u201cno subscription required.\u201d:<\/strong> Stitch Fix is known as one of the first major subscription box companies. The subscription is their business model. Or at least it used to be. With just three words, they communicate that what you thought you knew about this company is wrong. Those three little words also remove most of the resistance someone might have about signing up with them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>21.

It\u2019s a clever way to pack a lot of information into an ad while still making it easy to understand.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It shows the app\u2019s interface:<\/strong> This is another spin on the old \u201cshow them what it\u2019s like to use your product\u201d strategy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>22. TailWind<\/h2>\n<p>TailWind is a social media tool for Pinterest and Instagram.

Shopify<\/h2>\n<p>This ecommerce powerhouse is also a powerhouse of content creation, branding, and advertising in general.

It\u2019s right up there with \u201cfree.\u201d Consider split-testing ad copy that uses \u201cyou\u201d versus copy that doesn\u2019t. It can make a big difference.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>24. Metal Lovers<\/h2>\n<p>Embrace your tribe. Literally. Even if that means if you turn some people off.

This ad is an especially nice execution.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The ad format: <\/strong>This is a perfect use of a carousel ad, which is tailor-made for the series structure of this presentation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>33. Harvard Business Review<\/h2>\n<p>In an era when so many print and digital publications struggle, Harvard Business Journal seems to thrive. Their subscription marketing and advertising is a must-follow if your business does anything related to subscriptions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4050\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/HarvardBiz.png\" alt=\"Harvard Business Review ad aims at retention\" width=\"708\" height=\"698\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/HarvardBiz-66x66.png 66w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/HarvardBiz-200x197.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/HarvardBiz-300x296.png 300w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/HarvardBiz-400x394.png 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/HarvardBiz-600x592.png 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/HarvardBiz.png 708w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 708px) 100vw, 708px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>What Makes This a Great Ad:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s retention marketing: <\/strong>Retention marketing is always a good idea, and advertising is an essential part of that strategy. The return on investment for retention ads tends to be especially good.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It reminds existing customers of a feature they may have overlooked: <\/strong>Like the Slack ad earlier in this article, this ad is basically customer education. But that education is critical for HBR. The more features subscribers use, the more value they\u2019ll get out of their subscription. The more value they get, the less likely they\u2019ll be to cancel.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>34. BarkBox<\/h2>\n<p>Like Stitch Fix above, BarkBox is a subscription model ecommerce business. They don\u2019t have quite as much competition as some of the other advertisers we\u2019ve included here, but they\u2019re in a risky position in a tough economy: Dog toys and treats don\u2019t generally qualify as essential purchases.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4035\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BarkBox.png\" alt=\"BarkBox ad is fun and captures attention\" width=\"345\" height=\"492\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BarkBox-200x285.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BarkBox-210x300.png 210w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BarkBox.png 345w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>What Makes This a Great Facebook Ad Example:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s fun: <\/strong>Even in a down economy, people just want to have fun. They need a break. Ads that entertain may do especially well this year.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It uses misbehavior to capture attention:<\/strong> As some of us learned in childhood, misbehavior gets your attention every time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you want to kick this principle up a notch, get a photo of something about to go wrong. Preferably terribly wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Photos of things that are about to go terribly wrong are irresistible. Everyone wants to know what happens next.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>35. Oakley<\/h2>\n<p>There isn\u2019t a lot of space in Facebook ads. You have to get to the heart of things fast.

If someone could hold your product in their hands and look at it up close, they\u2019d be looking for details like this. So try a few super-close product shots in your ads.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It invites people to give in to their emotions:<\/strong> One of the best ways to sell luxury goods is to give people permission to indulge their desires. To reward themselves. Oakley does this deftly in this ad without overdoing it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>36. Big Agnes<\/h2>\n<p>As Seth Godin says, \u201cbe remarkable.\u201d Especially if you\u2019ve got a brand based on fun.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4036\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BigAgnes.png\" alt=\"Big Agnes ad uses 4 best practices\" width=\"349\" height=\"474\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BigAgnes-200x272.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BigAgnes-221x300.png 221w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/BigAgnes.png 349w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Why We Like This Ad Example:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It asks for audience participation in an unusually fun way: <\/strong>Big Agnes is an outdoor gear retailer that uses a considerable amount of personality in its marketing. It\u2019s embracing that quirkiness in this as by inviting people to camp out on their porches as a way to compensate for being in lockdown.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It employs four classic best practices for Facebook ads: <\/strong>In one ad, Big Agnes is&#8221;\n<ul>\n<li>evoking user-generated content.<\/li>\n<li>leveraging a larger cultural theme.<\/li>\n<li>showing your products in use.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0being weird and relatable in a way their audience will appreciate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>37. Rit Dye<\/h2>\n<p>Even if you aren\u2019t into crafts, Rit Dye is a brand worth following on Facebook.

The idea of being able to turn that waste into something fun is a new idea, and a great prompt to use their product.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>38. Duluth Trading Post<\/h2>\n<p>Sales are a great way to bring in new customers or to bring back existing customers. And Mother\u2019s Day is a great excuse to splurge a little.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4042\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DuluthTradingPost.png\" alt=\"Duluth Trading Post uses visual cue\" width=\"350\" height=\"484\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DuluthTradingPost-200x277.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DuluthTradingPost-217x300.png 217w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/DuluthTradingPost.png 350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>What Makes This Facebook Ad Example Great:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The pointing: <\/strong>See how the kid and the rod are pointing towards the copy?

Denny\u2019s<\/h2>\n<p>Instead of going silent like so many of its competitors, Denny\u2019s is advertising.

WebinarJam<\/h2>\n<p>WebinarJam is mostly known as a sales tool for digital marketers, but it can also be used as a training platform.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4141\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/WebinarJam.png\" alt=\"Webinar Jam ad has memorable tagline\" width=\"400\" height=\"602\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/WebinarJam-199x300.png 199w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/WebinarJam-200x301.png 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/WebinarJam.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Why This Facebook Ad Example is Great:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The tagline:<\/strong> It\u2019s interesting that it\u2019s six words. There\u2019s a whole movement around telling six-word stories.\u00a0The six-word story also happens to be a highly effective construct for social media advertising.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The image<\/strong>: Images often influence ad performance more than copy does, so picking the right image is critical. This image nails its messaging so perfectly that WebinarJam\u2019s competitors must be kicking themselves for not thinking of this sooner.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>41. Gymshark<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s one proven way to stand out and be true to your brand on social media: Be vulnerable and weird and honest. In a way your true peeps will understand.

Use them with testimonials wherever possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The testimonial:<\/strong> We opened this list of Facebook ad examples with a testimonial, so let\u2019s close with a testimonial. Especially a testimonial so strong and so clear that there\u2019s really not much else to say.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Think Beyond the Stock Photo &amp; Canned Copy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Any one of these 42 Facebook ad examples could lead to a huge boost in ROAS for your Facebook ad campaigns. But only if you test them. And probably only if you test them multiple times.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s what\u2019s so interesting (and humbling) about Facebook advertising. Often what we think will do well flops. Then the crazy idea we were sure would fail takes off.<\/p>\n<p>So yes, play it safe with your Facebook ads enough of the time to maintain the results you need. But don\u2019t play it too safe. The big leaps in advertising performance often come from risky, unusual ads.
