They&#8217;ve tasked you with helping them hit $1m monthly revenue by the end of the year.<\/p>\n<p>You know a bit about their business already: they did $250k in revenue last month, and the average customer spends $100 on their store. This is a good starting point, but now you need to figure out how to get them to $1m.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing you need to understand is whether this goal is even possible \u2014 you need an achievable goal to set the project up for success, and to set realistic expectations for your client.<\/p>\n<p>If the goal is indeed <em>possible<\/em>, you&#8217;ll now want to know whether it&#8217;s <em>probable<\/em> \u2014\u00a0are you actually likely to hit it?<\/p>\n<p>This is where a <strong>growth<\/strong> <strong>model<\/strong> can come in handy \u2014\u00a0a set of numbers and calculations that can help you answer questions like &#8220;is this possible?&#8221; and &#8220;is this probable?&#8221;, and help you &#8220;show your workings&#8221; to the client so that they understand your plan.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how you might set up a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alexbirkett.com\/growth-models\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">growth model<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Model A: top-down<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Last month, the client had 2,500 customers spending an average of $100 each, for $250k total revenue, and they want to hit $1m in monthly revenue by the end of the year. So, you need to 4x their business, and you have 6 months to do it.<\/p>\n<p>With a bit of number-crunching, you might end up with a model like this:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5343 aligncenter\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/growth-top-down.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"780\" height=\"533\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/growth-top-down-200x137.jpg 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/growth-top-down-300x205.jpg 300w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/growth-top-down-400x273.jpg 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/growth-top-down-600x410.jpg 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/growth-top-down-768x525.jpg 768w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/growth-top-down.jpg 780w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To get to $1m, you&#8217;ll need to grow their revenue by ~25% per month over the next 7 months.<\/p>\n<p>This is interesting, but not terribly useful \u2014<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>25% MoM growth might be possible for some businesses but not others.

If you want to increase <strong>Cart \u2192 Checkout conversion<\/strong>, you can try reducing friction. If you want to increase <strong>order value<\/strong>, you can experiment with promotions.<\/p>\n<p>By doing some simple calculations, you can create a simple model that represents the variables above.

To do this, you need your model to account for <strong>uncertainty<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Uncertainty with spreadsheets<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You can deal with uncertainty manually in a spreadsheet using &#8220;best-case&#8221;, &#8220;base-case&#8221;, and &#8220;worst-case&#8221; scenarios for each variable.<\/p>\n<p>This is very cumbersome, and adds a lot of complexity to your model \u2014\u00a0each input will have 3 separate cells, and each calculation will have 3 separate values \u2014\u00a0 your spreadsheet will triple in size.<\/p>\n<p>It also only shows you specific best-case, base-case, and worst-case scenarios, which don&#8217;t tell you the specific likelihood of hitting a particular number.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Uncertainty with standalone tools<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An alternative is to use a modeling tool designed to work with uncertainty, like <a href=\"https:\/\/causal.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Causal<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Embedded below is an ecommerce growth model built in Causal. It&#8217;s interactive, so you can play with the numbers, and you can easily account for uncertainty by using ranges (&#8220;$0.80 to $1.60&#8221;) instead of single numbers (&#8220;$1&#8221;)<\/p>\n<p>With this model, you can see the full range of possible outcomes for your project, and see the probability of hitting your goal at the end of the year. It&#8217;s up to you and the client to decide how much risk to take on \u2014\u00a0do you want to be 80% confident in hitting the goal, or 90%, or higher?<\/p>\n<p>Communicating your strategy to the client is important for setting expectations and keeping everyone aligned. Causal makes this easy by giving you an interactive dashboard that you can use with clients, letting you adjust assumptions and simulate scenarios in real-time:<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5348 aligncenter\" src=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/growth-model.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"780\" height=\"1260\" title=\"\" srcset=\"https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/growth-model-186x300.jpg 186w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/growth-model-200x323.jpg 200w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/growth-model-400x646.jpg 400w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/growth-model-600x969.jpg 600w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/growth-model-634x1024.jpg 634w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/growth-model-768x1241.jpg 768w, https://digitalgrowthstudios.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/growth-model.jpg 780w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A solid growth model lets you and your clients set realistic goals, and develop a strategy to hit them.
